this is a react project which consists of the login and sign up pages with nodejs backend.

# to make both the apps running, follow the below steps
1. clone the repository
2. cd Frontend/
3. npm install
4. npm start
## we can see that the react app runs on port 3000 (default),

# run the backend node js server too, 
5. cd to Backend folder
